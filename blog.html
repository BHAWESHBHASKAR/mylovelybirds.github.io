                <h2>This Couple Took Their Vows By The Beach A Year After A Pandemic Court Marriage</h2>
                <h3>Meet Pritisha and Amay</h3>
                <p>We are sure there are so many couples in the same boat as Pritisha and Amay! Couples who got married
                    during lockdowns no thanks to the pandemic- but that was not how they wanted to get hitched! And now
                    that the pandemic has put a pause on things for a while, they decided to go ahead and have the
                    destination wedding that they wanted to have in the first place- a good year after their court
                    wedding! We loved this cute celebration by the beach in Goa which looked like a hoot for everyone!
                </p>
                <p>Amay and I swiped right on a dating app; however we didn’t really speak much via the app as I was
                    doing my “background research”. He just moved back from the US where he lived for the last 11 years
                    so I knew he was assessing his options. Once I knew he was a genuine guy and kind of cute, I
                    casually started liking his Instagram pictures in the hopes of getting a response. A couple days
                    later, he messaged me on Instagram to check what I was doing that night and we were both
                    coincidentally at bars across the road from one another! He came to meet me immediately. Although we
                    were with friends, we spent that entire night talking and felt an amazing energy between us that
                    we’ve never felt with anyone else before. In fact, we took a picture together the first night we
                    met, which I have hung up on the walls of our apartment. We started dating and he stood by me like a
                    rock through the toughest of times (I lost my father in early 2020). </p>
